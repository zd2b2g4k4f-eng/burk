## 🖋️ About Me
With a background in **Linguistics (University of Constance)** and a career that spanned nearly a decade at **Google** (from Associate Linguist to **Language Lead**), I look at code differently. To me, a programming language is just another syntax to master for better communication.

Since 2021, I've been a freelance writer and web designer. My roots go back to 2007, starting with WordPress when the web was a very different place. Today, I'm evolving that design expertise into full-scale app development.

- 🧠 **Expertise:** Natural Language Engineering, UI/UX Design, Semantic HTML.
- 💻 **Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, WordPress, Grav CMS, and now building apps.
- ✍️ **Writing:** I document my journey on [Substack](https://letters.byburk.net) and [Medium](https://stories.byburk.net).

## 🚀 Current Focus: "Vibe Coding" & App Dev
I’m currently focusing on building apps that don't just work, but *speak* clearly to the user. I use **Anti-Gravity** to code and leverage my linguistic background to build better AI-driven interfaces.

- 🛠️ **Building:** [Briefly mention a current project, e.g., A custom Grav theme or a React app]
- 🧪 **Experimenting:** NLP prototypes and prompt engineering.
